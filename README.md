# Kaggle Competition 
This repository contains the code for a Kaggle competition, [House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques). <br><br>

### First submission
With the quick start, XGBoost is used with basic null value handling and data cleansing. The score is 0.14469 ranked 48%. 

### Second submission
Data cleansing (i.e. fill missing fields) has been done based on the data description provided by Kaggle. Same XGBoost configuration has been done. The score is 0.15039 which is lower than the first submission. It is because extra columns are created to handle null fields. This brings extra difficulties on the ensemble method.
